    <center><h1> Cascading stylesheet</h1></center>
    <h2>what is CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the visual presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen.
        It enables web designers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of multiple web pages all at once.
        In Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), cascading is the logic that browsers use to determine which CSS rulesets are most important when they conflict with each other.
         The cascade is central to CSS and is used to solve conflicts when multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element. For example, if a button is styled with both `button { color: red; }` 
         and `button { color: blue; }`, the cascade will determine that the button's text should be blue.</p>

     <h2>Inline styling</h2>
     <div> In inline styling CSS styles directly apply to the individual HTML elements using the style attribute.
        Inline CSS is the technique to define the single element with the insert style sheets in an HTML document. </div>
     <h2>Internal styling</h2>
     <li>Internal styling in CSS refers to the method of embedding CSS rules directly within the HTML document using the style tag.</li>
     <li>Internal CSS is a form of CSS using which you can add CSS to HTML documents. It helps to design the layout of a single HTML web page and change the styles of a web page within HTML code.</li>
     <h2>external  styling</h2>
     <pre>External CSS is used to style multiple HTML pages with a single style sheet. External CSS contains a separate CSS file with a .css extension.
        External CSS is a form of CSS which is used to add styling to multiple HTML pages at a time. It helps to design the layout of many HTML web pages simultaneously. 
        The external CSS is always saved with the .css extension, and through this file, we can change the complete style of our HTML web page.</pre>
